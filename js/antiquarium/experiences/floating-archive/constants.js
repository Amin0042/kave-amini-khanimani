// Shared palette + sizing constants for every Floating Archive module.
// Kept in one file so a future creative-direction pass (e.g. tuning the
// White Night atmosphere) only ever touches numbers here, not scattered
// hex literals through memory-star.js / atmosphere.js / particle-field.js.

// January8th identity — restrained use only (edges, halos, accents).
// See atmosphere.js for how sparingly these should actually appear once
// the White Night pass lands; this file only holds the values.

// STAGE 3 (Memory Star) — the base diameter of a Memory Star's circular
// core, before any per-artwork `scale` multiplier. Every star is a
// perfect circle now (see memory-star.js) — no aspect-ratio stretching
// — so a single diameter, not a width/height pair, fully describes size.
//
// Keep the archive readable at a glance at normal camera distance. The
// collection should be distinct and legible without needing the visitor to
// zoom into a single work, so the base circle size is raised again to make
// the image surfaces clearly readable at range.
