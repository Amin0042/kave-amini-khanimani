// Antiquarium — experiences/floating-archive/lifecycle.js
//
// STAGE 3 — the Memory Star lifecycle. Gives every star a continuously
// varying `coherence` value in [0, 1] instead of a scripted
// FORM → wait → DISSOLVE → wait → REFORM timer. index.js reads this
// value every frame and uses it to modulate the star's own material
// (memory-star.js) and its surrounding halo particles
// (particle-field.js) — this module only ever produces the number;
// what it visually means to be "coherent" lives in those other files.
//
// REFINEMENT PASS — full dissolution is now reachable. Stage 3 kept a
// hard floor (coherence never fell below ~0.12–0.22) so a star could
// never fully vanish. That's since been moved downstream: the floor
// belonged to how coherence gets *displayed* (memory-star's opacity, the
// particle halo's residual population), not to the number itself — see
// index.js and particle-field.js for where "never a sudden pop, but
// still a real zero" is actually implemented now.
//
// WHY THREE INCOMMENSURATE SINE WAVES, NOT ONE TIMER
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// A single sine (or a state machine with fixed durations) has one fixed
// period — however smooth it looks, a visitor who watches one star for
// a while can time it and predict the next dissolve to the second. That
// is exactly the "mechanically scripted" failure mode this stage was
// asked to avoid.
//
// Instead each star's coherence is the sum of three sine components
// whose frequencies are a base rate multiplied by 1, √2, and φ (the
// golden ratio) — irrational with respect to each other, then further
// detuned by a small per-star random factor. A sum of sinusoids at
// irrational-ratio frequencies is quasi-periodic: it never exactly
// repeats (contrast this deliberately with constellation.js, whose
// spatial recurrence was validated to be exactly periodic — here the
// opposite property, genuine non-repetition, is what the brief asked
// for). Locally it still looks like an ordinary smooth rise, plateau,
// decay, and dip — because it is one — but the beating between the
// three components means how long any given plateau or dip lasts keeps
// changing, cycle to cycle, in a way a single timer cannot fake.
//
// Every parameter below (base period, weights, phases, the small
// per-frequency detuning, the logistic steepness) is drawn once per
// star from a seeded generator — so no two stars share a
// period, a phase, or a duration, and no star's cycle exactly repeats
// even against itself. It is still a pure, deterministic function of
// elapsed time (same seed → same evolution every time), which is what
// keeps it feeling stable rather than jittery, per the brief:
// "deterministic enough to be stable, organic enough to appear
// continuously evolving."
//
// HOW THE CURVE ACTUALLY DWELLS AT ITS EXTREMES
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// The raw three-sine sum, normalized to [0, 1], is passed through a
// logistic ("S-curve") reshape with a per-star steepness `k`:
//
//   shaped = 1 / (1 + e^(-k · raw))
//
// A plain sine already spends more time near its extremes than mid-
// swing (its derivative is smallest at the peaks), but the logistic
// reshape pushes this further — a star lingers near full coherence or
// near full dissolution for a stretch (simulated: commonly several
// seconds to several tens of seconds, varying run to run, never a fixed
// duration), with a comparatively quick, smooth transition between —
// which is what actually gives the lifecycle its "existing → then
// fragmenting → then dissolved → then reforming" shape rather than a
// featureless wobble. `k` itself is random per star (see below), so how
// pronounced this dwelling is differs star to star as well.
//
// PULSE — a second, unrelated signal, on purpose
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Coherence is the star's slow, minutes-long arc through formation and
// dissolution. Pulse is a separate, much faster "is this star alive
// right now" heartbeat layered on top of whatever coherence state the
// star is in — a plain single sine is correct here (unlike coherence,
// a heartbeat is *supposed* to read as regular), with its own seed
// family so a star's pulse period/phase never lines up with its
// coherence timing or any other star's pulse. `samplePulse` returns a
// value in [-1, 1]; callers scale its (small) contribution themselves.
//
// STAGE 3.7 — curating what the FIRST frame looks like
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Everything above describes the ongoing, organic evolution correctly,
// but says nothing about where each star happens to be in its own cycle
// the moment the page loads — and left to pure per-star random phases,
// nothing prevents an unlucky arrangement where most stars are near
// their trough at once (which is exactly what was observed: "the scene
// can appear almost empty," with only ~2 stars visible).
//
// Rather than special-casing the first frame, every star gets a
// one-time `startOffset` baked into its own timeline: `sampleCoherence`
// and `samplePulse` are both evaluated at `elapsed + startOffset`
// instead of `elapsed` directly. This is a pure time-shift — it changes
// *where in its own cycle* a star starts, not the shape, period, or
// character of that cycle — so everything the earlier passes validated
// (quasi-periodicity, per-star independence, no synchronization) is
// unaffected; only the t=0 snapshot across all 16 stars is curated.
//
// `index` is bucketed into four roughly-equal groups (by position in
// the artworks array — an arbitrary but deterministic split, not a
// judgment about which artwork "deserves" to open coherent) with a
// target coherence band at elapsed=0 for each: mostly-coherent, rising
// (forming), falling (dissolving), and low/subtle. For each star, a
// small deterministic search tries ~120 candidate offsets spread across
// its own basePeriod and keeps one that actually lands in-band (picked
// pseudo-randomly among the matches, via this star's own seeded stream,
// so members of the same bucket don't all open at the same exact point
// in their cycle either) — falling back to the closest miss in the rare
// case nothing matches exactly (a very low-amplitude star, say, that
// never quite reaches the "mostly-coherent" band).
