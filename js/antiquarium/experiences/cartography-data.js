// Antiquarium — experiences/cartography-data.js
//
// Geographic data for "IRAN — CARTOGRAPHY OF MEMORY," kept entirely
// separate from cartography-of-memory.js: that file only knows how to
// turn coordinates into a scene, never what the coordinates are.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE BOUNDARY — where it came from, and why it isn't exact
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// `iranBoundary` is Iran's real national outline (mainland only — this
// first version omits the country's Persian Gulf islands, which are
// separate small polygons in the source data), traced from:
//
//   geoBoundaries — Iran, ADM0 (country boundary), "simplified" release
//   https://www.geoboundaries.org/  ·  https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries
//   Source file: geoBoundaries-IRN-ADM0_simplified.geojson
//   (commit 9469f09, fetched for this installation)
//
// geoBoundaries' own "simplified" export still carries ~2,200 points for
// Iran's mainland ring — accurate, but far more detail than a room-scale
// holographic outline needs or than a phone GPU should have to redraw
// every frame. The 229 points below are that same ring run through one
// further pass of Douglas–Peucker simplification (epsilon ≈ 0.05°),
// which drops points that sit within ~5km of the line already implied
// by their neighbors. The result is not a hand-drawn approximation —
// every point is a real vertex from the source polygon — just a much
// lighter-weight subset of them. If a future version needs the coastline
// closer to true resolution, re-run the simplification at a smaller
// epsilon against the same source file rather than hand-editing this.
//
// [longitude, latitude] order throughout (GeoJSON's convention, and the
// order core/geo-projection.js expects) — the opposite of the more
// familiar "latitude, longitude" pairing, so it's easy to transpose by
// habit when adding new data. First and last points are identical,
// closing the ring.

// HOW TO ADD A LOCATION
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// Add an object to the `locations` array below:
//
//   {
//     id: "unique-slug",
//     name: "Display name",
//     type: "city" | "historical-site" | "artwork" | your own category,
//     coordinates: [longitude, latitude],   // NOT [lat, lon] — see above
//     date: "optional, any free text (a year, a range, an era)",
//     description: "optional — one or two sentences, shown on the label",
//   }
//
// `type` isn't read by the rendering code yet — it's here so a later
// pass can style categories differently (a city marker vs. an artwork
// marker) without changing this file's shape again.
//
// Do not invent coordinates. Every entry below is the location's
// published [longitude, latitude] (the same values you'd find in that
// place's Wikipedia infobox or a gazetteer) — look up a new location the
// same way rather than estimating it from the map by eye.
